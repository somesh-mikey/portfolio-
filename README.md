# Somesh's Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my skills, projects, and creative journey as a web developer. The site is designed to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing overview of my work, with smooth navigation and responsive design.

## Features

- **Hero Section:**  
  Greets visitors with a dynamic, animated introduction. It cycles through different professional descriptions (e.g., "a Front End", "a Back End", "a UI / UX") and features an interactive "Read My Story" section.
- **Services Section:**  
  Highlights my skillset through clearly defined cards that describe my expertise in design, editing, front-end development, responsive web design, back-end development, and version control.

- **Contact Section:**  
  Allows visitors to get in touch via a contact form, which is connected through EmailJS for handling email submissions directly from the website.

- **Dark/Light Mode:**  
  Users can switch between dark and light themes, with the interface dynamically adjusting its colors for an optimal viewing experience in any lighting condition.

## Tech Stack

- **React:**  
  For building interactive UI components.
- **Vite:**  
  A fast and modern build tool for development and bundling.
- **Tailwind CSS:**  
  For utility-first CSS styling, ensuring a responsive and consistent design across all devices.
- **EmailJS:**  
  To handle contact form submissions and send emails without needing a dedicated back-end service.
- **ESLint:**  
  For maintaining code quality and enforcing best practices.

## How It Works

1. **Responsive Design:**  
   The website uses a mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS utilities. Each section adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

2. **Dynamic Content:**  
   The Hero section cycles through different professional roles, with animation effects handled via React state and CSS transitions.

3. **Smooth Navigation:**  
   A custom Navbar with smooth scrolling lets users navigate between sections. The active section is highlighted based on scroll position for an enhanced user experience.

4. **Contact Form:**  
   The Contact section includes a form that uses EmailJS to send emails. It features real-time feedback, alerting users upon success or failure of their message submission.
